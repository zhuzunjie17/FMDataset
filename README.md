# FMDataset
We release the dataset called **Fast sensor Motion Dataset**, which is used on our ICME'19 paper. **FMDataset** aims to verify the robustness of Dense-SLAM system at different velocities of sensor motion. 
It contains **color images, depth images and IMUs** gathered by a handheld sensor Intel realsense ZR300. Filtered depth images with better quality are saved in the file "filtered".  
This dataset contains 14 sequences with 6 different scenes. All datasets are divided into slow, medium and fast depending on the camera motion speed and the image blurry degree. To be more specific, as there is no explicit criteria to divide camera speed into slow and fast, thus we empirically set the motion without creating image motion blur as slow camera motion, and the motion which creates severe image blur as fast camera motion.
